# Sets Theory Educational Software
 My final year project. Focuses on set theory calculator and interactive, programmable Venn diagrams. Builds functionality around it. Aimed at CS students of my University who are learning mathematics. So they can have some automated tools for set theory calculations.  
 
### Presentation:
For this project, I had to make a YouTube presentation because of pandemic. I leave it here for anybody who would like to see the summary of functionality.

### Installation:
To run it, just download and run the <b>SetsTheoryCalc.jar </b> file. Make sure that windows runtime is up to date.  
To build it, the <b>dependencies</b> are:
* commons-lang303.9.jar
* hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
* javaluator-3.0.2.jar
* junit-4.12.jar

### About This Build
* The software was extending another software on boolean logic, but I do not have a right to include it here. Therefore, I had to crop out this project out of the full implementation. As a result, the last button in the menu "Back to Boolean Logic" is left non-functional.
* Thorough UI testing to be performed for MacOS and Linux operating systems.
